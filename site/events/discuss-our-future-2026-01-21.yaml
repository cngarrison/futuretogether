title: "Discuss Our Future: Preparing for AI's Impact"
description: |
  We often talk about the "future of work" as something distant. But the reality is, the timeline has accelerated. The shifts we are seeing now are not just about new gadgets; they are structural changes that will reshape how we work, how we access food, and how our communities function over the next 1–3 years.

  This isn't science fiction, and it isn't just about whether you personally use AI tools. It's about the broader societal ripples that affect us all.

  We need to move beyond the hype and have an honest conversation about adaptation and resilience.
