# What conditions make food preparation important?

I want to be upfront about why this topic feels awkward to raise.

The moment someone starts talking about food preparation in the context of societal disruption, certain images arrive uninvited: underground bunkers, freeze-dried ration packs, camouflage-wearing people who've spent twenty years waiting for civilisation to collapse. The prepper aesthetic. The survivalist fantasy.

That's not what this is. And because that association is so strong — and so genuinely off-putting — I think it's worth spending a few paragraphs being honest about the distinction before we get into anything practical.

## Prepper culture vs. community resilience

Prepper culture, at its core, is an *individualist* response to a perceived collective threat. The implicit logic is: things are going to fall apart, I can't trust anyone else, so I'm going to make sure *I* (and maybe my immediate family) have what I need when it does. It tends to be secretive, self-reliant, and oriented around worst-case scenarios as an almost-desired endpoint — a vindication that the fear was justified.

Community resilience is almost the opposite. It starts from the observation that humans have always navigated hard times best through cooperation, not isolation. It asks: *how do we maintain the basics for everyone in our community if normal systems are under stress?* It's oriented toward specific, realistic scenarios rather than civilisational collapse. And it treats social connection as the resource, not the stockpile.

The distinction matters because the practical actions they lead to are completely different. Prepper culture leads to individual hoarding. Community resilience leads to food networks, local growing capacity, mutual aid arrangements, and the kind of relationships where someone notices if you haven't been seen in a few days.

I'm interested in the second one. And it starts with being honest about the conditions that make it relevant.

## The conditions, ranked by likelihood

If you're using [Maslow's Hierarchy as a planning framework](/blog/how-can-maslows-hierarchy-frame-our-planning) — which I think is genuinely useful for thinking through what AI disruption might mean at a practical level — food sits at the base. It's physiological. Everything above it depends on it being secure.

So: under what conditions does food security become something we need to actively think about rather than assume?

I think there are three categories, and they're not equally likely.

### Near-term economic disruption — most likely

This is the one I'd focus on first, because it isn't speculative at all. It's already happening.

The economic displacement from AI is unevenly distributed. Knowledge workers whose roles involve research, analysis, writing, administration, legal support, basic coding, customer service — these are the people most exposed to near-term disruption. Some of that disruption will be gradual (augmentation, efficiency pressure, slower hiring), some of it will be sudden (a company decides to replace a team with a system that does the work for a fraction of the cost).

The pattern we'd expect to see is: pockets of significant unemployment concentrated in specific sectors and demographics, while other parts of the economy continue relatively normally. Not a collapse. A disruption — meaningful, painful, and for the people in its path, financially severe.

For households facing sudden income loss, food security follows employment security. The question of whether you can afford groceries is not a distant hypothetical for people whose income disappears faster than new employment appears.

This isn't about building a bunker. It's about the same logic that sits behind emergency funds, insurance, and leaving some slack in the budget. *Mild precaution against realistic risk.* The realistic risk here is economic shock from a disruption that's already well underway — and the people most exposed are often not in a position to absorb a multi-month income gap.

For communities, this translates into: knowing who in your network is economically exposed, having honest conversations about it, and building the kinds of informal safety nets — food sharing, cost-pooling, local growing — that communities have always used when formal systems let people down.

### Infrastructure disruption — less likely, but not negligible

Modern food supply chains are remarkable systems, and also remarkably fragile. The pandemic gave everyone a glimpse of this: supply chains that seemed permanent and reliable turned out to be just-in-time arrangements with no buffer, dependent on a chain of assumptions that a single disruption could break. Toilet paper was the joke. But for a period, finding basic goods required planning, effort, and sometimes luck.

Infrastructure disruption can come from several directions that don't require civilisational collapse:

**Extreme weather events.** Floods, prolonged drought, fire, major storms — these already interrupt supply chains periodically. Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of these events. Regional disruption for days or weeks is well within the range of things that happen, not hypothetical.

**Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure.** This is taken very seriously by security services in every developed country. Power grids, water systems, logistics networks — these are all digital now, and they're targets. A successful major attack on power infrastructure has knock-on effects for refrigeration, transport, distribution. Again: not a prediction. A risk that serious people with access to classified threat information are actively working to prevent.

**Pandemic disruption.** We've had one. There will be others. The particular features of COVID — disrupted supply chains, workforce absences, panic buying, sudden regional lockdowns — don't require a once-in-a-century event. They can emerge from a sufficiently severe seasonal flu, a new pathogen, anything that combines human illness at scale with the social responses that illness produces.

For each of these, the preparation that makes sense is *a few weeks of resilience*, not years of stockpiles. A household that can function for two to four weeks without accessing the normal supply chain is well-placed for these disruptions. That's a much more modest goal than it sounds — and it's the same logic behind keeping a spare tyre, or a torch and batteries for power outages. Common sense in the face of known risk.

### Catastrophic scenarios — least likely, but worth naming honestly

I'm going to name this category rather than pretend it doesn't exist, because one of the things I believe about this moment is that pretending not to see uncomfortable possibilities is how communities fail to prepare for them.

At the more extreme end of the risk spectrum — the scenarios serious researchers at organisations like [ALLFED (Alliance to Feed the Earth in Disasters)](https://allfed.info) study — are questions like: what happens to global food production if we face a major nuclear exchange (even a limited regional one), a supervolcanic eruption, or a large asteroid impact? Each of these produces the same mechanism: a significant reduction in sunlight reaching crops, extended across a season or multiple seasons.

ALLFED's work focuses on resilient food systems — specifically, what kinds of food production remain viable without sunlight (fungi, certain insects, some algae, leaf protein production), and how communities can rapidly build capacity for them. Their research is sober, scientific, and deliberately non-alarmist. They're not predicting these scenarios. They're asking: if any of them happened, how bad would it be, and what could we do?

The answer, without preparation, is: very bad. With decentralised community-level food production capacity built in advance, the picture is materially different.

I raise this not to alarm but to make a point about *why community food networks matter even at the least-likely end of the spectrum*. If your preparation response is personal stockpiling, you've addressed the near-term disruptions and done nothing for the scenarios where preparation actually determines survival. The only preparation that scales to serious disruption is distributed, community-level food production capacity — gardens, local growing networks, knowledge of what's edible in your region, relationships with people who have land and skills.

That also happens to be the most useful preparation for the scenarios that are actually likely. So it's the same answer regardless of which scenario you're planning for.

## What sensible preparation actually looks like

Let me be concrete, because the prepper aesthetic tends to crowd out the practical.

**For households:**

- A rolling four-week supply of non-perishables — things you'd actually eat. Pasta, rice, tinned tomatoes, tinned legumes, oats, olive oil, honey. Not special survival food; just slightly more of the things already in your pantry. Rotate them into your regular cooking so nothing expires unused.
- A way to cook without power. A simple camp stove with a gas canister is enough. This is the same thing you'd want for camping.
- A water supply. This is arguably more critical than food — humans need water far more urgently. A few large containers you can fill from the tap if supply is threatened, plus knowledge of local water sources, covers most scenarios.
- Basic medications and first aid. Not an elaborate medical kit. Just enough to not need a pharmacy for minor issues during a few-week disruption.

That's the household layer. It costs perhaps a few hundred dollars to set up, takes an afternoon, and requires almost no ongoing attention beyond rotating the pantry. It's the same kind of mild precaution that sensible people apply to fire extinguishers, emergency funds, and seatbelts.

**For communities:**

This is where it gets more interesting — and more aligned with what Future Together is actually about.

The most useful food resilience isn't individual. It's relational. It looks like:

- *Community gardens and growing networks.* Local growing capacity that exists independently of supply chains, operated by people who know how to tend it and know each other.
- *Skill sharing.* Knowledge of food preservation (fermenting, bottling, drying), basic growing, and what's edible locally doesn't need to live only in a few specialists. It can be distributed through the community through simple, social exchanges.
- *Food sharing culture.* Communities where surplus is shared rather than wasted, where a neighbour's vegetable garden produces more than they need and that surplus reaches people who need it, have structural food resilience that stockpiles can't replicate.
- *Local supply chain relationships.* Knowing your local farmers, having a relationship with a regional supplier, understanding the actual food production in your area — these connections are both economically useful normally and critically important if national supply chains are disrupted.
- *Mutual awareness.* Knowing who in your community is economically exposed, who is elderly and may struggle to access food during a disruption, who has skills and capacity that others don't — this is the social infrastructure of community resilience.

None of this requires catastrophising. All of it makes communities better in completely normal times, too. That's the defining feature of good preparation: it's useful regardless of whether the disruption you prepared for actually arrives.

## The deeper point: individual stockpiles have a ceiling

There's a useful thought experiment here. Imagine two adjacent neighbourhoods facing a three-month supply chain disruption.

Neighbourhood A has several households with significant personal stockpiles — months of supplies, carefully assembled. But they assembled them quietly, privately, because that's what prepper culture encourages. Nobody else knows the stockpiles exist. There are no gardens. There are no community food-sharing arrangements. When the disruption hits, the households with stockpiles are fine. The households without them are not. Eventually the households with stockpiles make difficult decisions about what their obligation is to the neighbours who are struggling.

Neighbourhood B has no major stockpiles. But over the previous few years, a local community group had started a food garden. A few people had learned to preserve food and shared what they knew. There's a WhatsApp group where people regularly offer surplus produce. During the disruption, the community pools what it has, the garden becomes more important, and people who know how to grow and preserve step into a community role. It's hard. But it's manageable — and nobody has to make the terrible calculation about what they owe their neighbour.

The difference isn't resources. It's relationships and distributed knowledge.

This is why [community is the most important preparation](/blog/why-community-is-the-most-important-preparation) — not just philosophically, but practically. The community that knows each other, that has built shared capacity, that has the relationships to mobilise mutual support, outperforms the collection of well-prepared individuals every time.

## A note on not getting ahead of yourself

I want to end with something grounding, because there's a risk that this kind of post sends people into a spiral of anxiety about scenarios they can't control.

Start with the boring stuff. Four weeks of pantry goods. A camp stove. A few water containers. That covers you for the scenarios that are actually most likely — the economic shocks, the short supply chain disruptions, the bad storm or flood that cuts off your area for a week.

Then start building community connections. Join or start a food garden. Get to know your neighbours. Have the conversations. Share skills. These things are intrinsically valuable regardless of disruption. They make life better now.

The catastrophic scenarios? They're the reason to support organisations like ALLFED doing serious research, and to have a society where these questions are taken seriously at a policy level. That requires collective political will, not individual preparation. Which, again, points back to community — and to the importance of having these conversations widely enough that they actually influence how societies respond.

Awareness first. Conversation next. Then action — proportionate, practical, and not paralysing.
