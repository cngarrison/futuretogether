# How can Maslow's Hierarchy frame our planning?

A friend of mine — smart, thoughtful, someone who has been paying attention — told me recently that she'd started learning Python.

She'd read about AI disrupting knowledge work. She'd absorbed the message that skills need updating. She'd decided to act. And so she signed up for a coding course, spending evenings and weekends working through exercises that, by her own admission, she wasn't sure she'd ever use.

I asked her: had she talked to her partner about what this might mean for their finances? Had she thought about whether her savings would carry them both through a period of instability? Had she looked at what other income sources might be possible if her industry contracted significantly?

She hadn't. She'd gone straight to the top.

This is the most common planning mistake I see. Not inaction — people are increasingly motivated to *do something*. The mistake is starting at the wrong level. Reaching for the sophisticated response before the foundational one. Building the third floor before the first.

Maslow's hierarchy is how I explain what I mean.

## Not psychology. A planning tool.

You may have encountered Maslow's hierarchy in a psychology class or a management seminar. The argument there is usually about human motivation — about how people pursue higher needs once lower ones are satisfied. Interesting theory. Not what I want to talk about.

What I want to talk about is the pyramid as a *prioritisation framework* — a way of deciding where to put your energy, in what order, when you're preparing for a future that's genuinely uncertain.

The structure is simple. Human needs arrange themselves into layers, from most foundational to most aspirational:

1. **Physiological** — food, water, warmth, sleep, shelter
2. **Safety** — financial security, stable income, health, protection from harm
3. **Belonging** — relationships, community, the feeling of being connected to others
4. **Esteem** — purpose, contribution, meaningful work, a sense of mattering
5. **Self-actualisation** — growth, creativity, becoming more fully yourself

The hierarchy's core claim is this: the lower levels provide the foundation that makes the upper levels possible. You cannot focus on esteem and purpose if you're not safe. You cannot build belonging if your physiological needs are unmet. The layers aren't equal — they're sequential.

For planning under uncertainty, this gives you something invaluable: a principled answer to the question *where do I start?*

## Why this framework is especially useful right now

Here's the honest truth about AI disruption: nobody knows exactly how it unfolds.

The range of credible scenarios spans from "significant but manageable economic adjustment" all the way to "fundamental restructuring of how most people earn a living within a decade." Serious, thoughtful people who are close to this technology hold positions across that entire spectrum. If you've read about [the alignment problem](/blog/what-is-ai-alignment-and-why-is-it-so-hard), you know there are also scenarios that go further — questions about what happens as AI systems become significantly more capable than current ones.

This uncertainty creates a planning problem. If the future is mild, some preparations look like overreaction. If the future is severe, some preparations look catastrophically inadequate. How do you prepare for a range you can't define?

The pyramid solves this problem elegantly. *Every level of preparation you do at the foundation remains useful across the entire range of scenarios.* If disruption is mild, solid financial foundations still serve you — they always do. If disruption is severe, those foundations aren't optional. The investments at the base of the pyramid are robust to uncertainty in a way that the investments at the top simply aren't.

My friend's Python course might be exactly right in some futures, and nearly irrelevant in others. But having three to six months of savings, a clear picture of her fixed expenses, and a realistic sense of how long it would take her to find new income — that's useful in almost every future she might face.

Start at the bottom. Work up.

## Level one: Physiological needs

In most disruption conversations, this level gets skipped because it feels extreme. Food and water? Surely that's prepper territory.

But consider what it actually means for supply chains to face sustained pressure. Economic disruption doesn't have to become societal collapse for it to create temporary, localised scarcity — in particular kinds of goods, in particular places, at particular moments. We all had a small lesson in this during 2020, when supply chain stress made certain things unexpectedly unavailable for periods that felt surprising in a modern economy.

I'm not suggesting you need a bunker. I'm suggesting that having two or three weeks of non-perishable food at home, knowing where your water supply comes from, and having thought briefly about what you'd do if you needed to manage without normal shopping for a fortnight — that is not extreme. It's prudent.

For most people in most scenarios, this level requires very little active preparation. The question to sit with is: *if normal supply chains were disrupted for two to four weeks, would my household be okay?* If yes, you're largely covered at this level. If no, a modest investment of time and money addresses it.

This is also the level where geographic context matters most. Rural or semi-rural households often have more inherent resilience here — gardens, local food networks, community knowledge about how to grow things. Urban households may have more work to do.

## Level two: Safety needs — the financial foundation

This is where most people in the developed world most need to focus, and where the AI disruption hits first and hardest.

Safety in Maslow's sense means: stable income, the ability to meet ongoing obligations, protection from the acute stress of not being able to pay for what your life requires. For most people, this is primarily a *financial* question.

The disruption to knowledge work is already happening, not arriving. Not uniformly — some roles are affected now, others will be affected later — but the direction is clear. What's happening to work is not a future concern. It's a present one.

So the safety-level questions are:

**Income:** How secure is my current income, actually? Not how secure does it feel — how secure is it? If AI can do a significant portion of what I do, how quickly might that become apparent to the people who pay me? What would I pivot to? How long would that pivot take?

**Emergency reserves:** The standard advice is three to six months of expenses. In a period of sustained labour market disruption, I'd suggest thinking about what twelve months would look like. Not because you'll necessarily need it, but because the peace of mind it creates frees up cognitive and emotional capacity for everything above it.

**Fixed obligations:** The higher your fixed monthly outgoings, the more vulnerable you are to income disruption. This is the moment to look honestly at what's non-negotiable versus what's habit. A smaller footprint doesn't mean a smaller life — it means more resilience.

**Diversification:** A single income source from a single employer in a single sector is a single point of failure. What would a second, more AI-resistant income stream look like? This doesn't mean turning yourself inside out — it means starting to think about it.

None of this is dramatic. All of it is concrete. And all of it is more useful, in more scenarios, than an app or a certification.

## Level three: Belonging needs — the community foundation

Once physiological and safety needs have your attention, the third level is where I think the most undervalued preparation happens.

Community is not a soft topic. It's not secondary to the practical stuff. It *is* practical.

I've written in more depth about [why community is the most important preparation](/blog/why-community-is-the-most-important-preparation), and I won't repeat all of it here. But the core argument in this framework is: in periods of significant disruption, the communities that navigate it best are the ones with strong pre-existing connections. Not the ones that were individually best prepared. The ones that already knew each other.

This is empirically consistent. The research on communities navigating economic disruption, environmental crisis, or social upheaval reliably shows the same pattern. Distributed trust and mutual obligation outperform individual stockpiling, every time.

From a Maslow perspective, this makes sense. You cannot maintain esteem — a sense of purpose and mattering — if you're isolated. You cannot self-actualise without the mirror of others to reflect and support your growth. The belonging level is the social infrastructure that makes everything above it possible.

For practical planning, belonging needs translate into:

- Who are the five people you'd turn to in a genuine crisis? Are those relationships active and maintained, or theoretical?
- Do you have community connections that extend beyond your immediate social circle — neighbours you know, local groups you're part of, people with different skills and circumstances?
- Are you contributing to others' security and support, not just your own? Belonging is reciprocal; communities exist only where people are committed to each other's wellbeing, not just their own.

Building these relationships isn't something you can do after the crisis arrives. The bushfire doesn't build community — it tests what's already there.

## Level four: Esteem needs — purpose and contribution

Here's where the conversation starts to shift from resilience to meaning.

Esteem needs, in a disruption context, centre on this question: *when the work changes, who are you?*

This matters more than it might seem. A significant part of how most people construct their identity is through what they do — their profession, their skills, their contribution. If those are disrupted — and for knowledge workers especially, they will be — the psychological weight of that can be significant, even when the material circumstances are managed.

The people I've seen navigate this well tend to have something in common: they have defined their contribution more broadly than their job title. A teacher who thinks of herself as someone who helps people grow — not just as a teacher — can find that identity available to her across many more contexts. A programmer who values problem-solving and building things is less attached to a particular technology stack than one who identifies as specifically a Python developer.

This is also where active contribution to addressing the disruption becomes its own form of esteem need fulfilment. People who have turned their attention toward this problem — who are educating others, building community, working on alignment, thinking about policy — often describe a kind of groundedness that comes from *doing something*. Not just enduring what's happening, but contributing a response to it.

You don't have to have the answers. You have to be useful to the conversation. That's enough to meet this need.

## Level five: Self-actualisation — what kind of future are we building?

At the top of the pyramid is the question that, in an AI disruption context, becomes not just personal but civilisational.

Self-actualisation is about becoming more fully what you have the potential to be. In an individual life, it's about growth, creativity, the pursuit of purpose. At a collective level — which is the scale at which this disruption is happening — it becomes: *what kind of world do we want to build with these tools, and are we actively working toward it?*

This is the level that's hardest to act on without the foundation below it. You cannot think clearly about what kind of future you want when you're worried about your rent. You cannot build movements when your community doesn't exist yet. The work at the top depends entirely on the work at the bottom.

But the top level also provides the *why* for all the levels below. If you're asking why you should bother with reserves and community and reskilling — the answer lives up here. Because there is a future worth building. Because the shape of what's coming is not yet fixed. Because the people who are paying attention, who are in conversation, who are connected and stable enough to act — those people have more influence over outcomes than those who aren't.

The self-actualisation question, practically: *given what I know, and given what I'm doing to prepare, what is my specific contribution to a better outcome?* Not a perfect answer — just a direction.

## Where to start (not where you want to start)

Here is the honest advice:

Most people, when they engage with this topic, want to start at level four or five. They want to think about purpose, about the future we're building, about what kind of society we want. These are genuinely important questions. They're also the questions that are hardest to act on without the foundation beneath them.

Some people go straight for level one. They start researching food storage, off-grid energy, self-sufficiency. For most urban and suburban people, this is premature — not wrong, but not where the leverage is right now.

The most underinvested level, for most people in most circumstances, is level two. The financial foundation. The honest audit of income stability, the emergency reserves, the question of what happens if the next eighteen months are significantly harder than expected.

The second most underinvested level is three. Community. The relationships and networks that don't exist at crisis time if they weren't built before.

So the practical answer to "where do I start" is probably somewhere you weren't planning to look. Not a new skill. Not a new cause. A financial spreadsheet and a conversation with someone you've been meaning to check in with.

Start at the base. Build upward. The top of the pyramid will still be there when you get to it — and you'll be far better placed to do something meaningful with it.
