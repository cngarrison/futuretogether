# What can you actually do right now?

If you've read through this series — or even just some of it — you've sat with some genuinely uncomfortable material. The displacement of knowledge work. The difficulty of alignment. The possibility of a technological transition that happens faster than our institutions can track. The question of what kind of future we're building, and whether we're building it intentionally.

That's a lot to carry.

So before anything else: let it settle. You don't have to resolve it today. The goal was never to leave you with a tidy action plan that fits on a Post-it note — it was to look honestly at something real, and to do that looking together rather than alone. If you feel a kind of alert clarity after reading — not panic, not paralysis, but a sense that *okay, this is actually happening, I need to be awake to this* — then the series has done its job.

Now comes the part that's actually the most important.

## The arc this series has been building

From the beginning, the framework underneath all of this has been three words: *Awareness. Conversation. Action.*

They're sequential because they have to be. You can't have useful conversations about something you don't yet understand. You can't take grounded action without the conversation that shapes it. And awareness without conversation tends to collapse into either anxiety or denial — both of which are ways of being alone with the material, which is the worst place to be.

The posts in this series were designed to move you through the first stage. [The founding essay](/blog/the-conversation-we-need-to-have) named the gap — between what's actually happening and what most people think is happening. [What's happening to work](/blog/what-is-happening-to-work) made that gap concrete and personal. [The alignment problem](/blog/what-is-ai-alignment-and-why-is-it-so-hard) explained why even the people building these systems stay up at night. [The singularity](/blog/what-is-the-singularity-and-why-is-it-so-critically-important) looked at the longer arc — not to frighten, but to honestly name what serious people are thinking about. And [why community matters most](/blog/why-community-is-the-most-important-preparation) brought it home: the preparation that matters is relational, and it has to happen before the disruption arrives, not during it.

That's the awareness stage. And if you're reading this post, you're ready to move into the next one.

## The most important thing you can do is also the simplest

Talk to someone.

Not on social media. Not in a comment thread where everyone is already performing a position. Talk to someone you actually know — a friend, a partner, a sibling, a colleague, someone in your life whose opinion you respect and whose future is bound up with yours.

Tell them what you've been thinking about. Say it imperfectly. You don't need to have it figured out — in fact, pretending you do is the fastest way to close the conversation down. The most honest opening is also the most effective one: *I've been reading about what's happening with AI, and some of it has really surprised me. Can I tell you what I've been thinking about?*

That's it. That's the action.

I know it sounds underwhelming. We want to feel like we're doing something proportionate to the scale of what's coming. And conversation — just talking — doesn't feel like a match for technological change at civilisational scale. But here's what I've come to believe, after the conversations that led to Future Together and the months of meetups since: awareness travels through exactly this mechanism. One person saying to another, *I've been looking at this, and I think we need to talk about it.* That's how the culture shifts. That's how communities start preparing. That's how pressure on institutions actually builds.

The café owner in the story from [the community post](/blog/why-community-is-the-most-important-preparation) didn't decide during the fires that she cared about her neighbours. She already knew them. The relationships already existed. What she did when the crisis came was an extension of what she'd already built. That's what we're doing — building those relationships, those conversations, that shared understanding — before the smoke is visible to everyone.

One conversation starts it. It doesn't have to be perfect.

## On staying engaged without going under

There's a version of awareness that tips into something less useful — the doom-scroll, the constant refresh, the habit of consuming more and more alarming material without it ever translating into anything except a kind of numbed dread. I want to name that, because the antidote is genuinely important.

The difference between awareness and anxiety isn't really about how much you know. It's about whether the knowing is connected to community and action, or whether it's happening in isolation. Anxiety is what awareness looks like when it has no place to go. Community is what gives it somewhere to go.

This is one of the things Future Together is genuinely for. It's not a lecture, and it's not a doom session. It's a space where people who are paying attention can think out loud together — where the hard questions get examined without pretending there are easy answers, and where the act of facing them collectively does something that facing them alone never quite manages: it makes the enormity feel navigable.

People arrive at the meetups carrying a version of what you might be carrying right now — the slightly vertiginous feeling of having looked at something that most people around them aren't looking at yet. And what almost everyone says, by the end of the conversation, is some version of: *I feel better for having talked about this with people who take it seriously.*

That's not naivety. That's not looking away. That's the beginning of something useful.

## A few practical starting points

Beyond the conversation — and only after the conversation, not instead of it — there are some things worth turning your attention to. I want to name them without turning this into a checklist, because a checklist is exactly the wrong frame. These aren't boxes to tick so that you've "done" preparation. They're threads you might follow, depending on what resonates with your own situation.

Understand what's actually happening in your field. If you work in knowledge work — writing, analysis, research, legal, medical, financial, creative work of any kind — the disruption [described in the work post](/blog/what-is-happening-to-work) is not a future scenario. It's happening now, unevenly, in ways that aren't always visible until they are. The most useful thing you can do is look clearly at your own domain: not to catastrophise, but to understand where the pressure is building and what that means for what you do. That honest assessment is the beginning of useful adaptation.

Pay attention to how decisions are being made. One of the less-discussed implications of the alignment problem is that AI systems are already being used to make consequential decisions — hiring, lending, medical triage, criminal sentencing — in ways that aren't always transparent, and that carry the biases of the data they were trained on. Knowing this exists, asking questions when you encounter automated decision-making that affects you, and supporting the push for transparency in these systems: these things matter. Not everyone can do policy work, but everyone can be an informed citizen about it.

Think about your community, not just yourself. Individual resilience has real limits. The communities that navigate disruption best are the ones with strong existing connections — people who know each other, trust each other, and feel mutual obligation to each other. That connection is built through ordinary things: showing up, staying in touch, investing in relationships that exist for more than professional utility. The texture of your daily life is where your community either exists or doesn't.

And keep learning. Not from a place of anxiety, but from a place of grounded curiosity. The alignment problem. The question of what a good future actually looks like and whether we're pointing toward it. The policy questions that will determine how this transition unfolds. The answers aren't settled — which means the conversation is still open, which means you're not too late.

## What we're not asking for

I want to be clear about what this isn't, because clarity here actually matters.

This isn't preparation for collapse. We're not suggesting you build a bunker, stockpile supplies, or withdraw from society in anticipation of civilisational breakdown. That framing — the survivalist, prepper-adjacent response to uncertainty — is the wrong one, and it's not where we're pointing.

This also isn't alarmism dressed up in calm language. We've tried throughout this series to be honest about uncertainty in both directions — the uncertainty that things could go badly, and the uncertainty that they might not. The people who know most about these systems hold both possibilities seriously. We should too.

And this isn't something that requires you to have it figured out. The most honest position available to most of us is something like: *I don't know exactly what's coming, I don't know exactly when, but I can see that something significant is in motion, and I'd rather face it with my eyes open and alongside people I trust than alone and surprised.*

That's enough. That's actually quite a lot.

## An invitation — and a genuine one

We've been meeting monthly since early 2025 — a group of people who are thinking about all of this together. Some come from tech backgrounds. Some don't. Some have been following AI developments closely; others arrived because a friend said *you should come to this thing* and they came not quite knowing what to expect. The conversations are honest, sometimes uncomfortable, often surprisingly hopeful. Nobody's selling anything. Nobody has all the answers. We're just a community of people who think this conversation matters and who'd rather have it than not.

The meetups run on the third Wednesday of each month, online, free to anyone who wants to join. If you've been reading through this series and feeling that slightly isolated sense of *I wish I had people to talk about this with* — this is that. This is exactly that.

You don't have to have read the posts. You don't have to have formed a view. You don't have to be an expert in anything. You just have to be willing to show up and think out loud for an hour with people who are doing the same.

The future is arriving. Let's face it together.
